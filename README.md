# Exploring SQL

This repository houses code for a series of blog posts (on Medium) about exploring SQL. This README.md file will serve as a roadmap to this repository. The repository is open and available to the public.

## Directories and files to be aware of:

1. A txt_files/ directory that houses (back-up) text files of SQL code that creates and queries SQL tables.
2. A data/ directory that houses a csv of Comet data used to create a sql table
3. A sql_files/ directory that houses the SQL statements to create and query tables
4. A notebooks/ directory that houses Jupyter Notebooks (Note: these files are unpolished and will be updated in a final stage of this project)
