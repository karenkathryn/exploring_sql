# Exploring SQL

This repository houses code for a series of blog posts (on Medium) about exploring SQL. This README.md file will serve as a roadmap to this repository. The repository is open and available to the public.

## Directories and files to be aware of:

1. A data/ directory that houses a csv of comet data used to create a SQL table
2. A sql_files/ directory that houses the SQL statements to create and query tables
3. A notebooks/ directory that houses Jupyter Notebooks (Note: these files are _very_ unpolished and will be updated in a final stage of this project.)

## Results
